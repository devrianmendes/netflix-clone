My first full project using ReactJS.

In this project I used the API provided by themoviedb.org to get all the information about the movies.
On each access, the home page will change, making a new request and taking a random item from the list.
It's a very simple project for academic purposes, but it's just the beginning. Soon I will bring more elaborate projects.

*Special thanks to @origamid and @b7web for the excellent teachings*
